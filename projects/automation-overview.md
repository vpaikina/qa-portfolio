# üìö Book Library API Automation ‚Äì Overview

This project is a robust API automation suite for a simulated Book Library system.  
It demonstrates advanced QA practices including end-to-end CRUD testing, integration scenarios, contract validation using Pydantic, dynamic test data generation, and real reporting with Allure.  
The framework is designed for maintainability, scalability, and clear reporting ‚Äì ready for real-world usage and CI/CD pipelines.

### 2. Project Structure & Test Cases

#### **Test Suites & Test Cases**

- **test_books.py**
  - `test_create_get_update_delete_book` ‚Äì End-to-end test covering book creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
  - `test_create_book_with_invalid_payload` ‚Äì Checks the API response for invalid input.
  - `test_update_nonexistent_book` ‚Äì Ensures proper error handling for updating non-existent resources.
  - `test_delete_book_twice` ‚Äì Validates behavior on repeated delete requests.
  - `test_get_book_schema_validation` ‚Äì Verifies API response contract with Pydantic or JSON Schema.
  - `test_bulk_create_books` ‚Äì Data-driven/parameterized test for creating multiple books.

### 3. How to Use 

#### **Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vpaikina/book-library-api-tests.git
   cd book-library-api-tests
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run local API with JSON Server:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000/books.

4. Running Tests
- Run all tests:
```bash
pytest -v
```
- Run with generating Allure report:
```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
```
- Run automated test suite with cleanup and open Allure report (recommended):

```bash
./run_tests_with_cleanup.sh
```
This script will:
- Automatically start the local API server (if needed)
- Execute all tests with data cleanup
- Generate and open the Allure report in your default browser 

5. Reviewing Test Results (not needed if tests were run by run_tests_with_cleanup.sh)
View Allure Report:
```bash
allure serve allure-results
```
The report will open in your browser with detailed test results, step traces, and attachments.
