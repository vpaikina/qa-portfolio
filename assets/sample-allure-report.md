## 📊 Sample Allure Report

Here’s an example of an Allure test report generated from my [API automation project](./projects/book-library-api-tests/). 
This report demonstrates a successful run of all test cases, including detailed summaries, individual test steps, attachments, and analytics.

> **Note:** One test in the suite is intentionally marked as `xfail` (“expected fail”) because of a known API [bug](./assets/sample-bug-report.md).  
> The failing test is included on purpose to showcase real-life reporting, transparent test analysis, and advanced use of Allure features for handling unstable or problematic cases.
